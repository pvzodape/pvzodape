### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### I am a postgraduate in Business Analytics and Finance. During my postgraduation, I became interested in Business Analytics and wanted to advance my learning. Hence, I started learning Python, SQL, Power BI, and Machine Learning. Further, I applied my learning to several projects, from classification models and NLP analysis to end-to-end analytics projects. I can turn raw business data into valuable insights. You can check some of my work on GitHub
